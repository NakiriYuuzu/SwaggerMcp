## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-25

### ðŸ”§ Critical Fix
- **Fixed Duplicate operationId Error**: Automatically handles Swagger documents with duplicate operationIds
  - Resolves "Validation failed. Duplicate operation id" errors that prevented certain Swagger documents from loading
  - Automatically adds unique suffixes to duplicate operationIds (e.g., `App_GetRainHourInfos_2`, `App_GetRainHourInfos_3`)
  - Specifically fixes compatibility with Taiwan WRA (Water Resources Agency) API: https://web.wra.gov.tw/wracbhydro2/WracbApi/swagger/docs/v1
  - Maintains backward compatibility and doesn't affect well-formed Swagger documents

### Technical Details
- Added `fixDuplicateOperationIds()` method to pre-process Swagger documents before validation
- Two-pass algorithm: first identifies duplicates, then systematically renames them with unique suffixes
- Comprehensive logging shows which operationIds were renamed and why
- Preserves original operationId for the first occurrence, only renames subsequent duplicates

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-25

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Enhancement
- **Improved Tool Naming Convention**: Tools now use a more readable `method-path-group-endpoint` format with hyphens
  - Example: `POST /api/Auth/SignIn` â†’ `post-api-auth-signin`
  - Example: `GET /api/Api/{id}` â†’ `get-api-api-id`
  - Example: `PUT /api/Application/settings` â†’ `put-api-application-settings`
- Better tool organization and readability in Claude Desktop
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing operationId values

### Technical Details
- Updated `ToolGenerator.generateToolName()` method
- Improved path parameter handling (`{id}` â†’ `id`)
- Enhanced character cleaning and validation
- All generated names are lowercase with hyphens for consistency

## [1.0.2] - 2025-07-25
