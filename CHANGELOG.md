# Changelog

## [1.1.18] - 2025-07-25

### Changed
- Restored 'app' component in tool names by removing it from the prefix filter list
- Tool names now include 'app' as a meaningful part of the path structure

### Updated Examples for WRA API
- `GET /App/Reservoir/Info/Day/{...}` â†’ `get-app-reservoir-info-day`
- `GET /App/Reservoir/Info/Hour/{...}` â†’ `get-app-reservoir-info-hour`
- `GET /App/Reservoir/Info/Realtime/{...}` â†’ `get-app-reservoir-info-realtime`

## [1.1.17] - 2025-07-25

### Fixed
- **Critical Fix**: Improved tool naming logic to exclude path parameters and use meaningful path components
- Fixed issue where paths with parameters would generate non-descriptive or duplicate tool names
- Now properly filters out parameters (e.g., `{id}`, `{BeginDate}`) and uses actual path segments

### Enhanced Tool Naming
- **Before**: `/App/Reservoir/Info/Day/{ReservoirID}/{BeginDate}/{EndDate}` â†’ `get-enddate`
- **After**: `/App/Reservoir/Info/Day/{ReservoirID}/{BeginDate}/{EndDate}` â†’ `get-reservoir-info-day`

### Technical Details
- Updated path parsing to exclude parameter segments (anything in `{braces}`)
- Added 'app' to common prefix filter list
- Now uses all meaningful path components instead of just the last one
- Generates descriptive tool names that reflect the actual API functionality

### Examples for WRA API
- `GET /App/Reservoir/Info/Day/{...}` â†’ `get-reservoir-info-day`
- `GET /App/Reservoir/Info/Hour/{...}` â†’ `get-reservoir-info-hour`
- `GET /App/Reservoir/Info/Realtime/{...}` â†’ `get-reservoir-info-realtime`

## [1.1.15] - 2025-07-25

### Changed
- Further simplified tool naming convention from `[method]group-endpoint` to `method-endpoint`
- Uses only the method and final endpoint name for maximum simplicity and readability
- Removed brackets from method names for cleaner appearance

### Technical Details
- Updated tool name format to use only `method` + `endpoint` (last path component)
- Examples:
  - `GET /api/Weather/forecast` â†’ `get-forecast`
  - `POST /api/Users/create` â†’ `post-create`
  - `PUT /api/Items/{id}` â†’ `put-id`
- Maintains 64-character limit compliance for Claude Desktop

## [1.1.14] - 2025-07-25

### Changed
- Simplified tool naming convention from `method-path-group-endpoint` to `[method]group-endpoint`
- Added automatic tool name length limit (64 characters max) for Claude Desktop compatibility
- Improved path parsing by filtering out common API prefixes (`api`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`)
- Enhanced tool name truncation with intelligent part preservation

### Fixed
- Fixed Claude Desktop error: "String should have at most 64 characters" for tool names
- Added smart truncation that preserves method and endpoint while removing less important middle parts

### Technical Details
- Updated `generateToolName()` method to use simplified format: `[method]group-endpoint`
- Added `truncateToolName()` method with intelligent truncation logic
- Filters out common API path prefixes to reduce name length
- Takes only the most significant path parts (usually last 2) for cleaner names

- Specifically fixes compatibility with Taiwan WRA API and similar malformed Swagger documents

### Technical Details
- Added `fixHostFieldFormat()` method to handle malformed host fields in Swagger 2.0 documents
